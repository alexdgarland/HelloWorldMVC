Hello World MVC
================

![Master Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexdgarland/HelloWorldMVC.svg?branch=master)

Simple toy project to play with MVC based (very loosely!) on [this tutorial](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/02/spring-mvc-helloworld-using-maven-in-eclipse/).

Also made extensive use of [tutorials at baeldung.com](http://www.baeldung.com/start-here) which seems like a pretty great resource.

## New & Improved!

- Fully converted to Kotlin for less verbose Java BS!
- Probably more lambdas than are strictly necessary!
- Extra added waving bear GIFs!

![Waving Bear](src/main/webapp/resources/images/hellobear.gif)
- Supports diverse backend repositories including:
    - Basically just an ArrayList!
    - Basically just a HashMap!
    - Some database or other (Postgres)!
